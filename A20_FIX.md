# A20 Gate Implementation - VMware Compatibility Fix

## Changes Made

The bootloader's A20 gate enablement has been updated to use the **Fast A20 Gate method (port 0x92)** instead of the problematic keyboard controller method. This resolves hanging issues in VMware environments.

### Previous Implementation (Problematic)
- Used keyboard controller (8042) method via ports 0x64/0x60
- Required complex `wait_8042` polling loops
- **Caused infinite hangs in VMware** due to different 8042 controller behavior

### New Implementation (VMware-Compatible)
- Uses **Fast A20 Gate method** via port 0x92
- Single, simple I/O operation: `in al, 0x92; or al, 2; out 0x92, al`
- **No polling loops** that could hang in VMware
- Includes A20 verification to check if already enabled

### Key Benefits
1. **VMware Compatible**: No infinite loops that cause hangs
2. **Faster**: Single I/O operation vs. multiple 8042 commands
3. **More Reliable**: Works across different virtualization platforms
4. **Simpler**: Eliminates complex wait loop functions

### Technical Details
- **Port 0x92 (Fast A20 Gate)**: Industry standard, well-supported
- **Bit 1**: Controls A20 line enable/disable
- **A20 Test**: Memory wrap-around test to verify A20 state
- **Timeout-Free**: No indefinite wait loops

### Code Changes
- Replaced `enable_a20()` function with Fast A20 Gate implementation
- Removed `wait_8042()` and `wait_8042_data()` functions
- Added reliable `check_a20()` function for verification
- **Only 3 functions modified** - rest of bootloader unchanged

This fix should resolve the VMware hanging issue while maintaining compatibility with QEMU and real hardware.
